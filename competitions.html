            <h3>Massachusetts State Championship (March 2, 2019)</h3>
            <h4>Think Award Winner, Ranked 25th</h4>
            <p>The MA State Championship wrapped up our incredibly fun, busy, and successful season. Although we worked really hard to build a perfect and compatible autonomous along with an efficient tele-op, the competition did not go as well as we had hoped. In our first two matches, our robot's phones suffered major disconnections that made it unable to run our robot. Unable to help our alliance partners, we ultimately lost both of those matches. By our third match, our phones were finally able to connect again and we won two of our three final matches. In matches our robot did not disconnect, we were able to consistently score 80-85 points in autonomous, 7-10 cycles in tele-op, and latch in end game. However, we were the rank 25 team after qualification matches and unfortunately we were not picked during alliance selection. Although we left the competition dissapointed without qualifying for the World Championship, we are proud of the way our robot performed. We won the Think Award for our organized notebook and will be saying goodbye to our senior members Ben, Guangchen, Owen, Thien, Nick, Arnold, and Jon.</p>

            <h3>Robostorm 4.3, Andover High School Qualifier (February 2, 2019)</h3>
            <h4>Inspire Award Winner, Semifinalist Alliance Captain, Ranked 5th</h4>
            <p>Robostorm 4.3 was really fun. Although we had a tough match schedule, our robot performed better than we expected. In matches where we did not collide with our alliance partner, our autonomous consistently scored 80 points when starting on depot side and 65 points when starting on crater side. Additionally, we were able to score a few cycles of minerals in the lander each match despite having minimal driver practice. After winning our first two qualification matches, we lost our third and fifth matches, putting us in 5th place. In alliance selection, we recieved the opportunity to be the fourth-seed alliance captain and we picked Team 8379 The Parity Bits to be our alliance partner. However, we did not advance to the Finals after losing a difficult series to the first-seed alliance of Team 8644 The Brainstormers and Team 4029 2 Bits and a Byte. Nevertheless, we won the Inspire Award and will be advancing to the MA State Championship!</p>

            <h3>Who Let the Bots Out, Canton High School Qualifier (December 15, 2018)</h3>
            <h4>Semifinalist, Ranked 12th</h4>
            <p>The Canton High School Qualifier was very difficult for us. Because this was the first qualifier of the season and we had issues with time management leading up to the qualifier, we were underprepared. We brought our preliminary robot to the competition hoping to win matches from achieving a full autonomous, however we had constant mechanical issues with our landing/latching mechanism that made our robot get stuck on the lander. After receiving a tie in our first qualification match and winning our next two, we lost our last two matches, putting us in 12th place. In alliance selection, we were selected by the fourth-seed alliance captain, Team 11953 CheezyBeanz, because when our autonomous did successfully land, it was able to also perform mineral sampling and place our team marker in the depot very consistently. However, due to the limitations of our tele-op performance, we lost in the Semifinals and did not win any awards. Nevertheless, we are confident we will bounce back and have diligently begun planning improvements for our new robot in preparation for Robostorm 4.3.</p>
